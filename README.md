# Hi ðŸ˜„.

I have a lifelong interest in science and technology. I especially enjoy building infrastructure and backend systems.

[NixOS](https://nixos.org) is the distro for the next ten years âš¡. No I'm not a functional programming zealot - that distro is simply awesome. Check it out.

Emacs is a better Vim than Vim :neckbeard:.

I always strive to learn from whoever is willing to teach me something new. Have a great day! :heart:
